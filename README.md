Using Electron React Boilerplate to create a desktop app for a smart mirror project. The project will have multiple features (news, YouTube, weather, etc.) and will be controlled by a cross-platform mobile app developed in React Native. The mobile app communicates with Firebase's realtime database to reflect changes in the desktop app (in realtime, of course).
